# Top 10

Hi, thank you for checking out my little project. This is a multiplayer server for the board game "Top 10" â€” my friends' and my favorite game, currently being rewritten into a simple library/framework for game networking.

The original server have been tested in parties. It worked fine, but there are still a lot to do:

- Allow player rejoin (done, tested)
- Game-lobby logic separation (done, tested)
- Add lobby management (done, untested)
- Add message handler on frontend (working)
- Better frontend

If you want to try the original version yourself, clone the repo and go to commit `19311578adb3702f2d7fe4a8ce6195a94f7ce798`. Build it with `go build .`. I didn't create a branch because I was lazy, sorry.
