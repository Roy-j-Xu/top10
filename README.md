# Top 10

Hi, thank you for checking out my little project. This is a multiplayer server for the board game "Top 10" â€” my friends' and my favorite game.

We have tested our server in parties and it works fine, but there is still much to do:

- Add lobby management
- Allow player rejoin
- Game-lobby logic separation
- Better frontend
- Better question set

If you want to try it out yourself, clone the repo and build it with `go build .`
